# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic NFT mint project.

so first we grab our Ether.js library from the repo and import it here, cause we will be using it for interacting to the blockchain 'smart contract' using the JSON-RPC protocol.
we deploy our contract or use mine,get the address and abi , add it to our constant file export it
we create our index.js, give it a type of module when adding it to our html file, because we will be using import statement in it, we also add or address and abi.

# our imports
import { ethers } from "./ethers-5.1.esm.min.js";
import { abi, contractAddress } from "./utils/constants.js";

# we select our html elements
const connectBtn = document.querySelector(".");
const mintBtn = document.querySelector(".");

# we call our connect function
check the js file, i did some few comments

# we call our mint function
which mints an nft for us , you can visit opensea to view your recently minted nft, deitch to testnet and choose matic network, or any testnet network you deployed to
